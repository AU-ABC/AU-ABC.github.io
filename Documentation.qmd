While it is always worth remembering an event which offers free cake ([especially when it recurs with a frequency like the ABC, as you could read here](https://louwalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Its-time-to-rethink-office-cake-Jan-2018.pdf)), you might want to read again what has been done and said after the sugar levels drop down.
