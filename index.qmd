# Welcome to the Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe {.centered}

<div style="text-align: center;">
An informal and collaborative cafe to help each other upskilling coding/bioinformatics skills. Hosted by scientists and bioinformaticians of the [Health data science sandbox](https://hds-sandbox.github.io) and [Bioinformatics core facility](https://biomed.au.dk/bioinformatics-core-facility) at Aarhus University.

## Concept

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}

Have you ever ended in a situation involving questions similar to those?

- <span style="font-size:1em;">Where do I start to code on a command line?</span>
- <span style="font-size:1.2em;"> How do I learn the basic R/python commands?</span>
- <span style="font-size:1.4em;"> What the heck is this error?????</span>

Do you feel finding the right tools is like going through a maze of software installations, versions and incompatibilities?

:::

What follows is the natural desire of throwing your computer out of the window. Don't worry! All the bioinformaticians/data scientists have gone through that, sometimes defined as part of the [Kubler-Ross curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief)^[Someone prefers to refer to the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) instead, but this is for people overestimating their abilities. It is not the case of coders: we know that we cannot do something when we get stuck!], where frustration is the point in which coding becomes challenging and we might feel lost.

The idea behind ABC is to bridge you beyond frustration moments, while at the same time offering a relaxed environment and the possibility to learn new things, help and get to know each other:

## Who can benefit from the ABC?
 
Everyone, really. Those that will particularly benefit from the ABC include:

- Biologists, bioinformaticians, and health scientists who wish to adopt coding-based solutions.
- Scientists and students who wish to accelerate the coding-based analysis of various types of data (such as OMICs data and other large-scale data) in research across Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital.
- Students and researchers who want an open environment where it is easy to get assistance and talk with others encountering similar issues (or maybe who already solved them!)

## Format
 
Each ~2 hour session of the ABC will feature:

- Topic Presentation: Insightful presentations on various bioinformatics and coding topics.
- Open Floor Session: A hands-on segment where staff from the Bioinformatics Core Facility and the Health Data Science Sandbox will be available to assist with any coding or bioinformatics issues.
