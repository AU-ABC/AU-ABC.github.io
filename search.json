This will add you to a project on uCloud, where we have data and extra computing credit for the course.\nBe sure you have joined the project. Check if you have the project OMICS workshop from the project menu (red circle). Afterwards, click on the App menu (green circle) \n\nFind the app Transcriptomics Sandbox (red circle), which is under the title Featured.\n\n\n\n\nClick on it. You will get into the settings window. Choose any Job Name (Nr 1 in the figure below), how many hours you want to use for the job (Nr 2; choose at least 3 hours, you can increase this later), and how many CPUs (Nr 3, choose at least 4 CPUs). Choose the course RNAseq in RStudio from the drop-down menu (Nr 4). Finally, click on the blue button Add Folder.\n\n\n\nNow, click on the browsing bar that appears (red circle).\n\n\n\nIn the appearing window, you should see already a folder called Intro_to_scRNAseq_R. Click on Use at its right (red circle)\n\n\n\nAfterwards, you should have something like this in the settings page:\n\n\n\nNow, click on Submit to start the app (the button is on the right side of the settings page)\nYou will now enter a waiting queue. When the session starts, the timer begins to count down (red circle), and you should be able to open the interface through the button (green circle). Note the buttons to add time to your session (blue circle) and the button to stop the session when you are done (pink circle)\n\n\n\nOpen the interface by clicking on the button (green circle of figure above). Sometimes you are warned of a missing connection: simply refresh the page. You will enter Rstudio, well-known interface to code in R.\nRun the following command to download the tutorial: download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hds-sandbox/ELIXIR-workshop/main/Notebooks/scRNAseq_Tutorial_R.Rmd\", \"tutorial_scrna.Rmd\")\nOpen the file tutorial_scrnaR.Rmd that should now appear in the file browser of Rstudio. Click now on visual (on the tool bar) if you need to see the tutorial in a more readable format.\nThe executable code is inside chunks (called cells) to be executed in order from the first to the last using the little green arrow appearing on the right side of each code cell.\nRead carefully through the tutorial and execute the code cells. You will see the outputs appearing as you proceed."

    "text": "An infrastructure project for health data science training and research in Denmark\nThe National Health Data Science Sandbox project kicked off in 2021 with 5 years of funding via the Data Science Research Infrastructure initiative from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Health data science experts at five Danish universities are contributing to the Sandbox with coordination from the Center for Health Data Science under lead PI Professor Anders Krogh. Data scientists hosted in the research groups of each PI are building infrastructure and training modules on Computerome and UCloud, the primary academic high performance computing (HPC) platforms in Denmark. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with one of our data scientists, please contact us here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur computational ‘sandbox’ allows data scientists to explore datasets, tools and analysis pipelines in the same high performance computing environments where real research projects are conducted. Rather than a single, hefty environment, we’re deploying modularized topical environments tailored for independent use on each HPC platform. We aim to support three key user groups based at Danish universities:\n\ntrainees: use our training modules to learn analysis techniques with some guidance and guardrails - for your data type of interest AND for general good practices for HPC environments\n\nresearchers: prototype your tools and algorithms with an array of good quality datasets that are GDPR compliant and free to access\neducators: develop your next course with computational assignments in the HPC environment your students will use for their research\n\nActivity developing independent training modules and hosting workshops has centered on UCloud, while collaborative construction of a flexible Course Platform has been completed on Computerome for use by the Sandbox and independent educators. Publicly sourced datasets are being used in training modules on UCloud, while generation of synthetic data is an ongoing project at Computerome. Sandbox resources are under active construction, so check out our other pages for the current status on HPC Access, Datasets, and Modules. We run workshops using completed training modules on a regular basis and provide active support for Sandbox-hosted courses through a slack workspace. See our Contact page for more information.\n\n\nPartner with the Sandbox\nThe Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers and educators. We’d like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk.\n\nWe thank the Novo Nordisk Foundation for funding support. If you use the Sandbox for research or reference it in text or presentations, please acknowledge the Health Data Science Sandbox project and its funder the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number NNF20OC0063268)."

This app is not alone, since our data scientist Jacob has also made the app ColabFold on UCloud, with methods for protein structure prediction.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTranscriptomics Sandbox : Our sandbox for bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and visualization - amongst others two regular workshops and provides stand-alone visualization tools.
