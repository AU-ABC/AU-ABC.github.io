    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty of learning bash is often underestimated by others, who expect people approaching bioinformatics to learn it automatically. Here we try to put together the first basic concepts and commands.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Why the bash command line?\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the bash command line becomes quickly essential if you are doing bioinformatics. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you might need it to **access a computing cluster** (for example, GenomeDK at Aarhus University), since most clusters runs on a [UNIX-based operating system](https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/unix-introduction), such as Linux, using a bash command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as important is the fact that on a command line you can very easily **do operations on multiple and very large files**, something you would not be able to do using, for example, `R` or `python`. Large sequences of operations can be automatized into **pipelines** (an advanced topic not for this tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "With a command line you can **run many small programs, compose them together, and organize them in a chain of commands**. This type of program organization fits well with what a bioinformatics project consist of: many tools to be applied repetitevely on multiple large files, and organizing those programs in a specific sequence. An example could be aligning to a reference genome many raw bulk-RNA sequencing files: the alignment operation must be repeated many times, and when files are finished, they might need to be merged if they are from the same sample.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a UNIX operating system (Linux, MacOs), everything on your computer fits one of two categories: **processes and files**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Processes are running instances of a program, and a program is any executable file stored in your computer. \n",
    "- A file is any collection of data (program, image, video, audio, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **terminal** is a text-based interface where you can write commands in various languages, depending on your choice. A terminal looks rather primitive, but it is what you often use on a daily basis to perform bioinformatics operations or control computing clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we write a command on the terminal and press enter, we have a shell receiving the code we wrote through the terminal. The **shell is the outer layer of the operating system**, which inteprets the commands and communicates them to the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **kernel is the core of the operating system**, managing the computer physical components (hardware) and interfacing them with the processes that need to run. In general, any program (browser, game, ...) you open or action (moving files, renaming folders, ...) you do on your computer ends up being a process managed by the kernel. This communication process is shown in @fig-shellkernel\n",
    "\n",
    "![Communication scheme where the outer layer is a bash shell command, which the shell then communicate to the kernel, which in turn manages the hardware resources to make the program actually run. Note that there can be **many languages for the UNIX shell**: bash is the most popular, but others exist and are used (for example *zsh* on MacOs). *Figure credit: InnoKrea.*](./2024-09-03-ABC4/shellkernel.png){#fig-shellkernel}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency and Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "We can roughly identify various levels of efficiency, manual work, speed, number and size of handled files when working with a command line, the typical languages like R and python, or bash pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Programming mode | Nr of files | File Size | operational speed | Manual work | \n",
    "| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------- |\n",
    "| R, python, ...   | from 1 to 10s   | small | package-dependent | A lot |\n",
    "| Command line     | from 1 to 100s  | 1-10s GB | fast | Low-moderate |\n",
    "| Unix Pipeline    | from 1 to many 1000s | many TB | fast | Low |\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see in this tutorial how we can use basic bash utilities and handle text files. Those files would take longer time to read in R and python and the code to modify them would be in general longer and slower.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Shell vs Python-R?\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the bash language and python or R are interpreted languages. You shouldn't consider them as opposed to each other, but rather as complementary. Bash can do many things python or R cannot do very efficiently: search for files, look for patterns in long text files, concatenate operations, create pipelines, be the preferred system language on computing clusters. Python or R are great to perform for example statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the best way to approach all those languages is to harness their advantages, instead of consider one of them \"worse\" than the others. \n",

    "\n",
    "In MobaXTerm you see only date, time and current working directory highlighted with various colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home directory ~\n",
    "\n",
    "The home directory, which can be written as `~`, is usually of the form `/home/username`, and is private to the user (no other users of that computer can access it).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the terminal, you always start with current working directory as your home. Try to write and execute (pressing enter) the command \n",

    "We have already been using directories and paths a lot, so it is time to polish some definitions. Files are organized in a directory tree, which restricted to the tutorial we are running looks like @fig-dirtree. Here `home` is a root folder, which is one of the top-level folder of your computer, so it has `/` at the beginning of its name. \n",
    "\n",
    "`/home` contains a folder with your username, which is right now your cwd. Inside your cwd you have the empty file and a directory `myFolder` containing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Directories and files are organized with a tree hierarchy, so that `/home` is the first level, `username the second`, and `myFolder` the third level. The path in the directory tree to `data.fastq.gz` is expressed as `/home/username/myFolder/data.fastq.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Directory tree of the tutorial. The home folder is a root folder (top-level of the tree) so its name starts with the `/` symbol. Other folders and files are at subsequent branch levels of the root folder `/home`.

    "\n",
    "#### Absolute and relative path\n",
    "\n",
    "The path `/home/username/myFolder/data.fastq.gz` is called **absolute** because independent of your cwd. Let's try another absolute path: the root folder `/usr` contains all executable files of the bash utilities we are using in this tutorial. Such files are in the folder `bin`. Execute\n",

    "\n",
    "On the contrary, the path `./myFolder/data.tar.gz` depends on the cwd, and is equivalent to write `myFolder/data.tar.gz`, because `./` is always included by default (`.` represents the cwd). **All paths that do not start with a root folder are relative!**.

    "2. **`Ctrl + E`**: Move the cursor to the end of the line.\n",
    "3. **`Alt + F`**: Move the cursor forward one word.\n",
    "4. **`Alt + B`**: Move the cursor backward one word.\n",
    "5. **`Ctrl + L`**: Clear the terminal screen\n",

    "#### **Editing Text**\n",
    "6. **`Ctrl + U`**: Delete the text from the cursor to the beginning of the line.\n",
    "7. **`Ctrl + K`**: Delete the text from the cursor to the end of the line.\n",
    "8. **`Ctrl + W`**: Delete the word before the cursor.\n",
    "9. **`Alt + D`**: Delete the word after the cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **History Navigation**\n",
    "10. **`Ctrl + R`**: Search through command history interactively (reverse-i-search).\n",
    "11. **`Ctrl + P`**: Previous command in history (equivalent to the up arrow key).\n",
    "12. **`Ctrl + N`**: Next command in history (equivalent to the down arrow key).\n",
    "13. **`!!`**: Re-run the last command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Command Completion and Expansion**\n",
    "14. **`Tab`**: Auto-complete file names, directory names, or commands.\n",
    "15. **`Alt + .`**: Use the last argument of the previous command in the current command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Other Useful Shortcuts**\n",
    "16. **`Ctrl + C`**: Terminate the current command (useful if things are stuck).\n",
    "17. **`Ctrl + D`**: Log out of the current shell (equivalent to `exit`).\n",
