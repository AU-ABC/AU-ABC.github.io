Experimental protocols to prepare biological samples are well described, and technical platforms to generate omics data from these samples are available in most research institutes. Furthermore, manufacturers constantly propose technical improvements, simultaneously decreasing the cost of experiments and increasing the amount of omics data obtained in a single experiment. In this context, biologists are facing the challenge of dealing with large omics datasets, also called “big data” or “data deluge.” Working with omics data raises issues usually handled by computer scientists, and thus cooperation between biologists and computer scientists has become essential to efficiently study cellular mechanisms in their entirety, as omics data promise. In this chapter, we define omics data, explain how they are produced, and, finally, present some of their applications in fundamental and medical research.},

              Background
              As biological data increase, we need additional infrastructure to share them and promote interoperability. While major effort has been put into sharing data, relatively less emphasis is placed on sharing metadata. Yet, sharing metadata is also important and in some ways has a wider scope than sharing data themselves.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we present PEPhub, an approach to improve sharing and interoperability of biological metadata. PEPhub provides an API, natural-language search, and user-friendly web-based sharing and editing of sample metadata tables. We used PEPhub to process more than 100,000 published biological research projects and index them with fast semantic natural-language search. PEPhub thus provides a fast and user-friendly way to finding existing biological research data or to share new data.

              Motivation
              The Gene Expression Omnibus has become an important source of biological data for secondary analysis. However, there is no simple, programmatic way to download data and metadata from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in a standardized annotation format.
            
            
              Results
              To address this, we present GEOfetch—a command-line tool that downloads and organizes data and metadata from GEO and SRA. GEOfetch formats the downloaded metadata as a Portable Encapsulated Project, providing universal format for the reanalysis of public data.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              GEOfetch is available on Bioconda and the Python Package Index (PyPI).},

              Background
              Organizing and annotating biological sample data is critical in data-intensive bioinformatics. Unfortunately, metadata formats from a data provider are often incompatible with requirements of a processing tool. There is no broadly accepted standard to organize metadata across biological projects and bioinformatics tools, restricting the portability and reusability of both annotated datasets and analysis software.
            
            
              Results
              To address this, we present the Portable Encapsulated Project (PEP) specification, a formal specification for biological sample metadata structure. The PEP specification accommodates typical features of data-intensive bioinformatics projects with many biological samples. In addition to standardization, the PEP specification provides descriptors and modifiers for project-level and sample-level metadata, which improve portability across both computing environments and data processing tools. PEPs include a schema validator framework, allowing formal definition of required metadata attributes for data analysis broadly. We have implemented packages for reading PEPs in both Python and R to provide a language-agnostic interface for organizing project metadata.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The PEP specification is an important step toward unifying data annotation and processing tools in data-intensive biological research projects. Links to tools and documentation are available at http://pep.databio.org/.},
