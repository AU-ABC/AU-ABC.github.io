The GenomeDK team is organizing a workshop to help you organize and run complex workflows using a simple python package on the cluster. The ABC (Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe) team is collaborating to help you get the most out of this opportunity.

## Intended audience

For users of GenomeDK who want to learn building complex and reproducible pipelines. Some of the content might be bioinformatics-specific.

## Date and location

October 23, 2025, 10:00-15:00 @ 1150-115

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of conda or pixi environments, text file editing, standard usage of the cluster. It is optimal if you are part of a project on GenomeDK - if not you can still follow along with the exercises!

- Why pipelines?
- Main pipeline languages
- Think through your pipeline architecture
- Dependencies
- Set software up and prepare your first pipeline
- Submit!
- Polish your resource requirements
- Wrap up
