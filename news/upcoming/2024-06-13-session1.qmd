The very first session of the ABC (Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe) will launch **on june 13th, at 13:00 in the hall of AIAS** (the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies).

Everyone is welcome to **join independently of coding skills and level**. In this first meeting we will also distribute a survey, so that participants can give some ideas about expectations and topics of interest.

## Purpose
 
The ABC aims to:

- **Support and guide** in  using bioinformatics and programming tools.
- Provide support for **coding-related issues**.
- **Enhance** the coding skills of participants in fundamental programming languages (R, python, bash command line).
 
## Who can benefit from the ABC?
 
Everyone, really. Those that will particularly benefit from the ABC include:

- Biologists, bioinformaticians, and health scientists who wish to adopt coding-based solutions.
- Scientists and students who wish to accelerate the coding-based analysis of various types of data (such as OMICs data and other large-scale data) in research across Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital.
- Students and researchers who want an open environment where it is easy to get assistance and talk with others encountering similar issues (or maybe who already solved them!)

## Format
 
Each 2 hour session of the ABC will feature:

- Topic Presentation: Insightful presentations on various bioinformatics and coding topics.
- Open Floor Session: A hands-on segment where staff from the Bioinformatics Core Facility and the Health Data Science Sandbox will be available to assist with any coding or bioinformatics issues.
