The ABC is organizing a series of short OMICS workshops, led by PhD student Mohamed Hassan with help from the ABC bioinformaticians and other health PhDs. The first workshop in the series will focus on R and the Tidyverse collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization. These will be a common set of tools used in virtually all OMICS analysis in R, so attending this one is highly recommended if you plan to attend the rest of the series. **There will be some optional take-home exercise, and you are welcome to come to the following ABC (coding cafe on 12.march) to ask more questions about the topic and your own datasets.**

## Intended audience

All levels are welcome, from complete beginners to more experienced users. The workshop will start from the basics of R, and then move on to Tidyverse packages.

## Date and location

February 26, 2026, 12:00-16:00 @ 1241-114

## Prerequisites
