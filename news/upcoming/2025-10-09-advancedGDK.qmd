The GenomeDK team is organizing an advanced workshop to get you to the next level with high-performance computing on GenomeDK. The ABC (Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe) team is collaborating to help you get the most out of this opportunity.

## Intended audience

For all users of GenomeDK, especially those already with some knowledge of the system.

## Date and location

October 9, 2025, 10:00-15:00 @ 1613-109 (Asklepius)

## Prerequisites

Standard usage of the cluster: basic file management, some understanding on how the cluster works, software environments and editing of files.

## Topics:

- web applications and tunneling
- Containerized software
- Data synchronization with rsync
- Pipelines and your first pipeline submission

Some of these topics might be adjusted based on the audience and their needs - so consider them more as guidelines than a strict program.
