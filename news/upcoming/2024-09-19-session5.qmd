Everyone is welcome to **join independently of coding skills and level**. 

## Agenda
 
We have a very minimalistic agenda consisting of

- What's new
- What's on our screens
- Tutorials and Open Coding

The tutorials we propose are of increasing difficulty (and [documented](../../Documentation.qmd) at each meeting. For this meeting we do not have new tutorials, but will rely on the previous ones and on an [interactive single cell workshop](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/scverse-2024-workshop/) one of us have been giving at a conference.

Of course, you can also **bring your own code and issues and get help from us**.
