The ABC is organizing a series of short OMICS workshops, led by PhD student Mohamed Hassan with help from the ABC bioinformaticians and other health PhDs. This second workshop in the series will focus on the R analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. You will learn how to explore and use spatial transcriptomics data using popular R packages. There will be an introductory lecture followed by hands-on exercises. **There will be some optional take-home exercise, and you are welcome to come to the following ABC (coding cafe) to ask more questions about the topic and your own data.**

## Intended audience

Students and researchers wanting to know more about and how to analyze scRNA-seq data using the Seurat package.

## Date and location

May 21, 2026, 12:00-16:00 @ 1241-114
## Prerequisites

Your laptop with R and Rstudio installed. Knowledge of R, tidyverse and generic understanding of spatial transcriptomics data might be helpful.

## Material

Tutorial and slides will be added in our [Documentation](../../Documentation.qmd) page prior to the workshop.
