The 22nd session of the ABC (Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe) will be **on Thursday, October 16th, at 13:00-15:00 in building 1231-228**

Everyone is welcome to **join independently of coding skills and level**. 

## Agenda
 
This ABC will be a drop-in session where we will try to help you with your bioinformatics and data science issues. And maybe, you can even help each other, or teach us something new!

## Signing up

To sign up, simply drop a mail to **abcafe [at] au.dk**, so we know how much cake and tea/coffee we need. But if you decide to show up spontaneously or last minute, you are of course very welcome as well!
