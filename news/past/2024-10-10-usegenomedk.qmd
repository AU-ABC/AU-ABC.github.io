## Agenda

The topics for the workshop are all at introductory level, such as

- login and account setup
- file system
- command line intro
- software management
- projects on GenomeDK
- file transfer
- jobs

There are no prerequisites apart from having a working account on GenomeDK with a complete 2-Factor authentication. Also, bring your laptop, so we can try out live some commands and exercises on the cluster.

There will be a lunch break 12-13, with lunch **not included** in the workshop. We will serve coffee and cake.

There is time for questions and problem-solving, so come with your issues if you are already a GDK user.
