Everyone is welcome to **join independently of coding skills and level**. 

## Agenda
 
We have a very minimalistic agenda consisting of

- What's new
- Accessible topic presentation
- Tutorials and Open Coding

The tutorials we propose are of increasing difficulty (and [documented](../../Documentation.qmd) at each meeting. This time we have

- `R` analysis of bulkRNA sequencing data
