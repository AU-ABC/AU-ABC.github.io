Everyone is welcome to **join independently of coding skills and level**. 

## Agenda
 
We have a very minimalistic agenda consisting of

- What's new
- Accessible topic presentation
- Tutorials and Open Coding

The tutorials we propose are of increasing difficulty (and documented) at each meeting. This time we have a choice of

- A small dplyr project managed with RStudio
- Install Anaconda and python basics
